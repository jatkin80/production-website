I've utilized the NASA APOD API to display the Astronomy Photo of the Day on the main page and created a form to allow the user to pick a date that will link to a new page with the image captured on the specified date.

Additionally:

* The site should pass the [WebAIM's WAVE test](https://wave.webaim.org/) with no errors or contrast errors
* The HTML should pass the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* The JavaScript should pass the [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) JS linter with no errors or warnings




* [ ] - Passes WAVE with no errors or contrast errors
* [ ] - Passes the W3C Validator
